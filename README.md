# Stocks Playground

Check out the deployed app here: [drorata-stocks-playground.streamlit.app](https://drorata-stocks-playground.streamlit.app/). Feedback is welcomed!

## Motivation

The initial motivation of this dashboard was to compare the value changes of financial assets.
I was not able to find exactly what I wanted, so I wrote it.
Thanks to [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) this was amazingly easy and fun!
The data source is [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) and the data is extracted using [`yfinance`](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance).

## Running locally

```bash
conda conda env create -f environment.yml
